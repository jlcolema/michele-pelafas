There is a distinct balance between salon lighting fixtures and decorative beauty salon lighting.

A warm temperature bulb (2,700 to 3,500 Kelvin temperature) is the most flattering on the complexion and compliments most salon interiors.  Cool temperatures (4,800 Kelvin temperature) can equate to daylight (a sunny afternoon) and is typically not the most flattering temperature (think about being out in broad daylight and how your skin looks in the sun).  Daylight/cool temperature bulbs will grey-out warm interiors as well as wash-out guests.	</p>	<p>		Salon Lighting Should Accurately Render Color.Have you ever heard stories about guests receiving hair color only to walk outside and the color appears differently?  The simple solution is to utilize bulbs in the space that accurately renders color.  How well a bulb accurately renders color is determined by the bulb's Color Rendering Index which represents the quality of light and its faithfulness to render colors.  Always request bulbs that have a Color Rendering Index (CRI) of 86 or higher.	</p></div><div class=""category-seo"">	<p>		Salon Lighting Should be Positioned to Eliminate Shadows.How a guest looks in the salon chair is paramount in the salon environment.  If a guest feels good about their appearance, it reinforces a positive experience for repeat business and increased revenues.  The easiest way to help eliminate shadows on the face is to position lighting at the mirror on either side to directly light the complexion.  This too should be a flattering temperature bulb (2,700 to 3,500 Kelvin).  Spotty lighting above, such as track fixtures, will also create shadows.  In this type of application, wall lighting on the face is even more important.		I	</p>	<p>		Invest in Energy-Efficient Bulbs for Long-Term Savings. LED salon lighting bulbs have revolutionized energy efficient lighting.  When possible, request LED salon lighting fixtures that support these types of lamps.  With a wide variety of color temperatures and high Color Rendering Index options, LED bulbs are ideal for the salon environment.  Although these lamps are typically higher in cost to purchase, the investment is worth it as these lamps have long life, use less energy, save on maintenance and replacement costs and provide long term savings.	</p>	<p>		Quality Lighting Counts.As in anything, quality matters.  LED and florescent bulbs, while a wonderful source of general lighting, can be flat.  There are thousands of sources for LED lighting and for as many quality options on the market there are just as many poor ones.  Look for LED hair salon lighting bulbs that replicate Halogen bulbs, have a high CRI (Color Rendering Index) and have high quality optics that bring just enough sparkle to the space to show the depth, dimension & shine to the fabulous hair that you produce.	</p>	<p>Remember, the best lighting for your salon combines a variety of lighting to suit its particular purpose.  While you do not have to be an expert here, the idea is to be able to effectively communicate the basics so that you can explore all of your lighting options to fit your budget and ensure a successful result.	</p>	<p>Written by:  Michele Pelafas, ASID, IIDA (copyright 2017 Michele Pelafas, Inc.)	</p>	<p>Michele Pelafas, Inc. is a professional salon design company and provides interior design services for salons including lighting and ceiling design and fixture planning.	</p></div>",,,N,N,N,N,,0,8,7,4,,

As the name depicts, it has a sweet but subtle glow- perfect for every day.  I cannot describe myself as a pink lover - I have been avoiding it in my wardrobe for years (although I am feeling it this spring).  No surprise, my color of blush is not bright or flashy.  In fact, my go-to pinky shade is a bit of a neutral with a beige and taupe undertone making it irresistibly modern.  I love how it pairs with a dark taupe shadow and accents of warm wenge and soft whites for a wistful coolness.  At the same time, its subtle glow exudes a peaceful serenity and delicate femininity. <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;""><br /></span>",,,N,N,N,N,Lifestyle Products > Color Stories & Samples,,7,7,3,,
